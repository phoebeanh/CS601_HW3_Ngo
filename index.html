                <h3>Welcome!</h3>
                <p>
                    My name is Phoebe Ngo. I live in Seattle, WA. I am a second year graduate student
                    at the Boston University, beginning my degree in the fall of 2020. 
                    I am studying to get my Masters degree in Software Development.
                    I am passionate about learning how I can use my creativity in the world of web application development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am taking this CS601 because I am interested in becoming a UX/UI Designer. I am currently primarily a backend software developer,
                    but I have learned that backend software is not where my passion lies. Designing delightful interfaces and experiences for users is where
                    I find the most value in my work, so I hope to expand my repertoire of skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript in this class.
                    So far in my academic and professional careers, I have focused on my algorithmic, backend, and database design skills, so I hope to add some 
                    frontend knowledge to my skillset.
